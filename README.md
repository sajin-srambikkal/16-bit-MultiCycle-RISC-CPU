# MultiCycle-RISC-CPU

This repository contains RTL files of two versions of multi cyle 16 bit RISC CPU with custom set of instructions. 

Detailed design inculduing Datapath design, Controller design and Instruction set etc are explained in the Multi_Cycle_Design.pdf.

VHDL Source code etc are given in respective implementation folder. Project is simulated using Xilinx Vivado toolset. Xilinx distributes memory IPs are used to simulate the data memory and instruction memory. COE files requied to initiate the instruction memory with the program to find the maximum number out of the 10 numbers stored in the datamemory is also attached.
